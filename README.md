# data-analysis-course-project-2025
Data analysis course project for the class of 2022

### Instructions to start the project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start working on the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b "studentID_your_real_name"
```

From here, you can start working on your project. Make sure to commit and push your changes regularly like this:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message about what you changed"
git push --set-upstream origin studentID_your_real_name
```

The project will be evaluated based on the quality of your code, analysis, and report. Good luck! I will share the data via WeChat group and then provide write access to the repository. On the deadline, I will revoke your write access and your last commit on your branch will be considered as your final submission.

Please see the `data/README.md` file for details about the dataset. You should place the data files in the `data/` folder as well. You can submit your code as python files or Jupyter notebooks. The final report should be named as `report_<studentID>.pdf` and placed in the root folder.
